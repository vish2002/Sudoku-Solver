<p>I have created a Sudoku solver Web app.</p>

<h1>I have used :</h1>
JavaScript: Utilized for the Backtracking algorithm and interactivity.
HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
CSS: Provides styling to create an appealing user interface.

<h1>Basic Rules:</h1>
Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
Each column must also contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.

<h1> Solving with Backtracking</h1>
<p>The Sudoku Solver employs the Backtracking algorithm to find solutions efficiently. Backtracking is a recursive technique that explores potential solutions and backtracks when it encounters inconsistencies, ultimately leading to a valid solution or indicating that no solution exists. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for solving Sudoku puzzles, as it efficiently explores the puzzle space and ensures the validity of each move.</p>
